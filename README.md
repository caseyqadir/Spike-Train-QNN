# Spike-Train-QNN
Quantum Neural Network for Neuronal Spike Train Classification. Solo Project.

For the Quantum Computation Course taught by Professor David Zaret at Johns Hopkins University, Fall 2023.
Applied & Computational Mathematics Master of Science

A neuronal 'spike' is when a neuron fires or reaches an action potential. Neuronal Spike Train Data gives time series data on when a single neuron fires and how frequently. In September 2022, a paper was published on the Spikebench dataset (source), exploring new classical machine learning approaches to the classification and understanding of these neuronal spike patterns. The accompanying GitHub repository (source) is available publically for use.

While the paper has opened new avenues for neuronal spike train analysis, its reliance on classical computational mechanics limits its capability to capture the underlying complex correlations present in spike train activities. The intricate relationships within their firing sequences, the differentiation between neuronal types, and the associations between individual spike train activities and the broader neural circuit states present challenges that classical mechanics might not fully address.

Quantum Machine Learning is currently limited by number of qubits and quantum noise and errors, but it nevertheless has the potential to overcome these classical shortcomings. This project seeks to complement this recent research by introducing quantum computing methodologies to the field, thereby exploring whether Quantum Machine Learning might be an avenue to overcome the limitations of classical approaches.
